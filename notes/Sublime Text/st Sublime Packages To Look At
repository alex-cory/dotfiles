COLORHIGHLIGHTER 		 		( https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Color%20Highlighter )


NEED TO HAVE :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DocBlockr - is a Sublime Text 2 package which makes writing JSDoc comments and PHPDoc comments a breeze.

Bracket Highlighter - Bracket Highlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: [], (), {}, "", '', <tag></tag>, and 
					  even custom brackets.

ApplySyntax - ApplySyntax is a plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3 that allows you to detect and apply the syntax of files 
				that might not otherwise be detected properly. For example, files with the .rb extension are usually Ruby files, but when they are found in a Rails project, they could be RSpec spec files, Cucumber step files, Ruby on Rails files (controllers, models, etc), or just plain Ruby files. This is actually the problem I was trying to solve when I started working on this plugin.

AdvancedNewFile - This plugin allows for faster file creation within a project. Please see the Features section for 
				  more detailed information about advanced features.
