VCS: This is what allows all our developers to work on the same code base without stepping on eachothers toes along 
	 with some other added benefits.  It's basically like a record of the changes you make to the files.
		- repository (collection of commits)
		- browse project history
		- collaborate
		- tools great for really complex projects


Cowboy Coders: choose to work without regards to common best practices


Versions are also called Commit's


In UNIX-based systems, hidden files and folders are indicated by having their name prefixed with a '.' - so a file named repository isn't hidden, but a file named .repository would be. Windows doesn't respect this convention, so don't be surprised if your "hidden" repository folder is perfectly visible on a Windows machine. Just pretend it isn't there :)
