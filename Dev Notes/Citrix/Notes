Things to Focus on Learning:
	- React.js
	- Isomorphic
	- Node.js
	- webpack
		- Github: https://github.com/webpack/webpack
		- Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser. Allows to split your codebase into multiple bundles, which can be
		  loaded on demand. Support loaders to preprocess files, i.e. json, jade, coffee, css, less, ... and your custom
		  stuff. 	http://webpack.github.io
			- AMD: (Asynchronous Module Definition) is a JavaScript specification that defines an API for defining code modules and their dependencies, and loading them asynchronously if desired. (http://bit.ly/1bKXPtG)
			- CommonJS: is a project with the goal of specifying an ecosystem for JavaScript outside the browser (for example, on the server or for native desktop applications). (http://bit.ly/1J70Yl9)
		- webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle javascript files for usage in a browser, yet it
		  is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
