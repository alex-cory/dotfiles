### CAS: Central Authentication Service
  - a single sign-on protocol for the web. Its purpose
    is to permit a user to access multiple applications
    while providing their credentials (such as userid and
    password) only once. It also allows web applications
    to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's
    security credentials, such as a password. The name CAS
    also refers to a software package that implements this
    protocol.

### IRC: Internet Relay Chat
  - is an application layer protocol that facilitates the transfer of messages
    in the form of text. The chat process works on a client/server networking
    model. IRC clients are computer programs that a user can install on their
    system. These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages
    to other clients. IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion
    forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private
    messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

### FOSS: Free and open-source software
  - is computer software that can be classified as both free software and
    open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy,
    study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly
    shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design
    of the software. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the
    software is under restrictive copyright and the source code is usually
    hidden from the users.
