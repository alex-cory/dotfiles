Linus Torvalds
	- Inventor of Git
	- father of the Linux OS
	- Still maintains the Linux Kernel


The Linux Kernal
	- Over 15 million lines of code
	- About 3,500 new lines of code are added every day
	- Every new kernel released involves aproximately 1,000 developers


Git
	- Linus designed it to maintain the Linux Kernal
	- If it can help keep a project of that magnitude running smoothely, think what it can do for your projects

Why Git?
	- Distributed VCS (centralized VCS has many disadvantages)
	- Built to build VCS's but ended up gaining some commands of it's own and turned into a fully functional VCS
