RewriteEngine On
# AcceptPathInfo On  ( for ignoring a deprecated path )

# basically think of the REQUEST_FILENAME statements like this:
# IF ( REQUEST_FILENAME doesn't equal an actual File ) {
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

	# IF ( REQUEST_FILENAME doesn't equal an actual Directory ) {
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

		# THEN rewrite
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]

 #	}
	
#}


#  .*   - basically says select everything
#   $   - basically makes it a variable
#  [L]  - basically means This is the Last Thing you do
#
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]
