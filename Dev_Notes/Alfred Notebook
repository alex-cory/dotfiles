Usage
 
Keyword is mailto
mailto + ENTER — compose a blank mail (no recipients)
mailto [part of name or email address] — search your Contacts for matches. You can also add email addresses not in your Contacts.
ENTER/⌘+NUM — add selected email address to recipient list and go to email program
TAB — add selected email address to recipient list and continue searching
mailtoconf — see and change current settings
mailtohelp — show help
mailtoclient — set a new email client to use (default is to use system default email client)
mailtoformat — set whether to send name + email to client or just email (some clients can't handle name + email). Default is to send name + email except to clients that can't handle names (Airmail).
If you've entered an invalid email address, it will be removed from the recipient list when your email app is called.
 
Supported apps
 
In theory, MailTo should work with any email client (it uses the mailto: protocol).
 
Tested and working with:
Mail.app
Airmail
Sparrow
MailMate
Unibox
Thunderbird
Google Chrome (webmail)
Does not work with:
Safari (it will just open your system default email client)
Not tested (don't have it):
Outlook
