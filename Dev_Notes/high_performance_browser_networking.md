Ch 1. Primer on Latency & Bandwidth
-----------------------------------

### Speed is a Feature 
  - Faster sites lead to better user engagement
  - Faster sites lead to better user retention
  - Faster sites lead to higher conversions

#### Latency 
  The time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it

### Bandwidth
  Maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path

### Propagation Delay
  Amount of time required for a message to travel from the sender to receiver, which is a function of distance over speed with which the signal propagates.

### Transmission Delay
  Amount of time required to push all the packet's bits into the link, which is a function of the packet's length and data rate of the link.

### Processing Delay
  Amount of time required to process the packet header, check for bit-level errors, and determine the packet's destination.

### Queuing delay
  Amount of time the incoming packet is waiting in the queue until it can be processed.
