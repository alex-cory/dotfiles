cron

Examples
The following specifies that the Apache error log clears at one minute past midnight (00:01) of every day of the month, of every day of the week, assuming that the default shell for the cron user is Bourne shell compliant:

1 0 * * *  printf > /var/log/apache/error_log
The following line makes the user program test.pl—ostensibly a Perl script—run every two hours, at midnight, 2am, 4am, 6am, 8am, and so on:

0 */2 * * *  /home/username/test.pl
Another example showing how to run a shell program called export_dump.sh at 0th minute of 20th hour, every day.

00 20 * * * /home/oracle/scripts/export_dump.sh
