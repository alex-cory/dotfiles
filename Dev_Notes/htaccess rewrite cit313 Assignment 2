# Tell Apache you want to utilize the rewrite module
RewriteEngine On

# Specify the url prefix, only really necessary when resources are not

# Local
RewriteBase /
# Remote
# RewriteBase /alecory/Spring-2014/CIT-31300/Assignment%202/


# Compare the requested path to the files in the web root and if it doesn't 
#   match a file the condition is meet so check the next condition. 
# '-f' (is regular file)
# 	Treats the TestString as a pathname and tests whether or not it exists, and is a regular file.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# Compare the requested path to the directories in the web root and if it 
#   doesn't match a directory the condition is meet so check the next condition.
# '-d' (is directory)
# 	Treats the TestString as a pathname and tests whether or not it exists, and is a directory.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# No more conditions so execute this rewrite rule: rewrite everything to be 
#   'index.php'. NC is to ignore case ( not really necessary since you are 
#   already rewriting everything ), and L signifies that this should be the 
#   last rule executed.
RewriteRule ^ index.php [NC,L]
