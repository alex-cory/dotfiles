10 Command Line MySQL Time Savers 		(http://goo.gl/1ujT71)


1. Automate the Login Process --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A properly configured MySQL server will require you to authenticate by specifying at minimum a username and password, typically done by passing the username along as an argument to the mysql command, and then for security purposes entering the password blindly via a subsequent prompt:

	%>mysql -u root -p
	Enter password:
	Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
	...

Go through this ritual a few thousand times over the course of a year, and you've just lost several hours of time due to merely logging in. Eliminate this tedious step by creating a file named .my.cnf and placing it in your home directory. If on Windows, name the file my.ini and place it in your MySQL installation directory. In this file, add the following information, replacing the placeholders with your login information:

	[client]
	host     = your_mysql_server
	user     = your_username
	password = your_password

Be sure to set this file's permissions appropriately so prying eyes can't access the sensitive data.



2. Automatically Switch to a Database --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After logging into the client you'll need to switch to the desired database, typically done using the use command. For instance:

	mysql>use wjgilmore_dev;
 
 
If you're working exclusively on a particular project and want to save yourself the hassle of this additional step, identify the database within the configuration file introduced in the previous step by adding the following line within a section named [client] (the same used in the previous section):

	database = your_database_name
