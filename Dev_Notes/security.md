#### CRIME (Compression Ration Info-leak Made Easy)
  -  a security exploit against secret web cookies over connections using the HTTPS
     and SPDY protocols that also use data compression.[1][2] When used to recover
     the content of secret authentication cookies, it allows an attacker to perform
     session hijacking on an authenticated web session, allowing the launching of
     further attacks.
