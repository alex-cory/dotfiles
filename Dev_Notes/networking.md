## Achronyms

#### WSN: [Wireless Sensor Network](http://bit.ly/1AQvMFl)
  
  - (sometimes called a wireless sensor and actor network (WSAN)) are spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc.

#### HTTP: [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](http://bit.ly/1AQwMsW)
  
  - an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

#### HATEOAS: [Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State](http://bit.ly/1ImMC17)
  - a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from most other network application architectures. The principle is that a client interacts with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

#### SOAP: [Simple Object Access protocol](http://bit.ly/1HRbV64)
  - a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on other application layer protocols, most notably Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

#### SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

#### IP: Internet Protocol Suite

#### TCP: [Transfer Control Protocol](http://bit.ly/1ATfc7I)
  - It is used for connection-oriented transmissions.

#### OSI: Open Systems Interconnection

#### LDAP: The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
  - is a directory service protocol that runs on a layer above the TCP/IP stack. It provides a mechanism used to connect to, search, and modify Internet directories. The LDAP directory service is based on a client-server model.

#### TLS: [Transport Layer Security](http://bit.ly/1IqA6uV)
  - its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

Vocabulary
----------

#### [HTTP tunneling](http://bit.ly/1ASgTSW)
  - a technique by which communications performed using various network protocols are encapsulated using the HTTP protocol, the network protocols in question usually belonging to the TCP/IP family of protocols. The HTTP protocol therefore acts as a wrapper for a channel that the network protocol being tunneled uses to communicate.

#### Tunneling protocol
  - allows a network user to access or provide a network service that the underlying or current network does not support or provide directly.

#### Payload
  - The data portion of a packet

#### [Proxy Server](http://bit.ly/1G0kPjp)
  - a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity. Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems.[1] Today, most proxies are web proxies, facilitating access to content on the World Wide Web and providing anonymity.

#### PubSub: [Publish Subscribe](http://bit.ly/1ATdDqf)
  - a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Instead, published messages are characterized into classes, without knowledge of what, if any, subscribers there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are.

#### [Transport Layer](http://bit.ly/1ATfEml)
  - provides end-to-end or host-to-host communication services for applications within a layered architecture of network components and protocols.[1] The transport layer provides services such as connection-oriented data stream support, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing.

#### [Client](http://bit.ly/1AThJ1I)
  - A client is a computer program that, as part of its operation, relies on sending a request to another computer program (which may or may not be located on another computer).
