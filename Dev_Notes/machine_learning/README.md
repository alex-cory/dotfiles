Machine Learning
================

Overview
--------
Itâ€™s a subfield of computer science stemming from _pattern recogintion_ and  _computational learning theory_ in artificial intelligence. In industrial context, could be referred to as _predictive analytics_ or _predictive modeling._  "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E <sub><sup>(Tom M. Mitchell)<sub><sup>".

Types
-----
### Supervised Learning
- The program is given example inputs and desired outputs given by a "teacher" where the goal is to learn a rule that maps inputs to outputs.
- [Wikipedia](sl-wiki)

### Unsupervised Learning
- No labels are provided to the algorithm leaving it alone to figure out structure to it's input. Discovering hidden inputs in data.
- [Wikipedia](ul-wiki)

### Reinforcement Learning
- A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle), without a teacher explicitly telling it whether it has come close to its goal or not. Another example is learning to play a game by playing against an opponent.

#### Difference Between Datamining & Machine Learning
 - Machine learning:
   - focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data
   - usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge
 - Data mining:
  - focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data. This is the analysis step of Knowledge Discovery in Databases.
  - the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge

### Terms
 - [Backpropagation](bp) - an abbreviation for "backward propagation of errors", is a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of a loss function with respect to all the weights in the network.
