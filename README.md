fast Hacks
==========

This is a library of my notes, what I am currently learning, and what I want to learn.  I am making this because by documenting the things that I learn will help me learn them better as well as help others hopefully gain knowledge as well.  I also will be posting ideas that I have.  Now there's always some I might keep just for myself but if anyone ever takes advantage and creates one of these ideas that I didn't get to, please please let me know just because I want to use it! :D
